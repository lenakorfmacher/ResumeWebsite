# My Resume Website

This project is a personal resume website showcasing my education, experience, skills and projects. It was developed to provide a professional online presence and serve as a portfolio for potential employers and collaborators.

## Usage

To view and navigate the resume website, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The site is structured with HTML for content, styled with CSS (including Bootstrap for responsive design), and includes JavaScript for any interactive elements.
